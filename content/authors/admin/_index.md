I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Industrial Mathematics, University of Bremen, Germany. During my Ph.D. I worked on principled ways to construct neural network architectures. I am fascinated by the mathematical foundations of deep learning, in particular in generative modeling and robust invertible neural networks. 

My goal is to combine a deep understanding of machine learning with an application-driven mindset. I enjoy working on problems arising in life science, see e.g. my publications on Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and broadly in industrial applications. My background is in applied mathematics, with a focus on modeling complex phenomena, signal processing, and machine learning.
